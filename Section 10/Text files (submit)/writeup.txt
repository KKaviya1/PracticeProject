Design Overview:
----------------

Student class:
The Student class represents a student in the school and has two properties (Name and ClassAndSection) These properties store the name of the student and the class and section the student belongs to, respectively.

Teacher class:
The Teacher class represents a teacher in the school and has two properties (Name and ClassAndSection) These properties store the name of the teacher and the class and section the teacher is associated with, respectively.

Subject class:
The Subject class represents a subject offered in the school and has three properties (Name, SubjectCode, and Teacher) The Name property stores the name of the subject, the SubjectCode property stores a unique identifier for the subject, and the Teacher property references the teacher who teaches the subject.

DataStorage class:
The DataStorage class is designed as a Singleton to ensure that there is only one instance of the data storage throughout the application. 
It contains three lists (Students, Teachers, and Subjects) which are used to store instances of Student, Teacher, and Subject objects, respectively. 
The class follows the Singleton pattern by having a private constructor and a static method GetInstance() that returns the single instance of the class. 


Main Function:
--------------

The Main() function serves as the entry point of the Console application. 
Inside this function, we perform the following tasks:

Create the DataStorage instance:
We create an instance of the DataStorage class using the GetInstance() method to ensure that we work with the same data storage throughout the application.

Fill up the lists with dummy data:
We use the class to create instances of students, teachers, and subjects and add them to their respective lists in the DataStorage instance.

Display students in a class:
We iterate through the Students list in the DataStorage instance and filter out students belonging to a specific class and section. 
We then display the names of these students.

Display subjects taught by a teacher:
We iterate through the Subjects list in the DataStorage instance and filter out subjects taught by a specific teacher. 
We then display the names of these subjects.

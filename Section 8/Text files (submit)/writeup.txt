INTRODUCTION:
A simple console application that reads student data from a file, allows the user to search for a student by name, and then displays the list of students both in their original order and sorted by name.

EXPLANATION:
The program prompts the user to enter the name of the file from which student data will be read.
It reads the content of the file located at the specified path.
After reading all the data, the program displays the list of all students as it was read from the file.
It then sorts the list of students based on their names in ascending order.
The program prompts the user to enter a student name to search for in the list.
It performs a case-insensitive search on the list for the student with the specified name.
If the student is found, it displays their name and class; otherwise, it shows a message indicating that the student was not found.
Any exceptions that occur during the execution of the program are caught and handled, displaying an error message.
The Console.ReadKey() method waits for a key press before closing the console window, allowing the user to see the results.
